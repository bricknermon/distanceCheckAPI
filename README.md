# distanceCheckAPI
With the help of ChatGPT I hope to create an API that allows a convenient alternative to the question "How far is this from me?"


## Purpose: 
Hobby API project, develop convenient distance checker from "static" starting address. 
I am limited in my programming capabilities, but with the help of ChatGPT, I can create cool stuff : )


## Use Case:
Rather than having to input the starting location and paste the destionation on a new
or seperate webpage, if this functions properly, it can save the extra steps. No need to open a new
webpage, copy the destination address, type your starting location, and click search, all you need
to do is input the destination address and the hard work will be done by this API : )
